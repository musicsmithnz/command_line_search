## command_line_search

This is a command to search the internet in one of  search engines: Google, Yandex and Duckduckgo and open the results in Links2. The usage is as follows:

'''
s <g,y,d> <search arguments>
'''

Here is an example google search for '10 most useful bash commands':

'''
s g 10 most useful bash commands
'''

Here is the same search in Duckduckgo:

'''
s d 10 most useful bash commands
'''

Here is a yandex search for 'what is the best search engine':

'''
s y what is the best search engine
'''

I think this is a great time saver, allowing you to quickly look things up when you are working from within the command line
